    "# An Introduction to Analysing In the Spotlight Data Using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to help you become more familiar with the data structures used to store [LibCrowds](https://www.libcrowds.com/)' results data, as well as introduce you to a key Python librarys that can be used to request, manipulate, analyse and visualise that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python library used here is called [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). It provides access to high-performance data analysis tools via an accessible Python interface. We will use the library to load all of our *In the Spotlight* results into a structure called a dataframe. A dataframe is a two-dimensional data structure, similar to a spreadsheet, that accepts many different kinds of input. As everything is stored in memory, rather than on disk, the only limitation to this type of data structure is going to be the amount of RAM installed on the computer. However, for any modern computer this is unlikely to be an issue until we reach tens of millions of results.\n",

    "## The dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, our input for this notebook will be all of the results generated so far through the crowdsourcing projects presented on [*In the Spotlight*](https://www.libcrowds.com/collections/playbills). These results are stored as Web Annotations; a W3C standard used to make data more easily reusable online. The abstract from the [Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model) is presented below:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Annotations are typically used to convey information about a resource or associations between resources. Simple examples include a comment or tag on a single web page or image, or a blog post about a news article.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The Web Annotation Data Model specification describes a structured model and format to enable annotations to be shared and reused across different hardware and software platforms. Common use cases can be modeled in a manner that is simple and convenient, while at the same time enabling more complex requirements, including linking arbitrary content to a particular data point or to segments of timed multimedia resources.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The specification provides a specific JSON format for ease of creation and consumption of annotations based on the conceptual model that accommodates these use cases, and the vocabulary of terms that represents it.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this standardised structure for our final results we aim to make the crowdsourced data generated via the LibCrowds platform more easily reusable online, providing ways for researchers to answer specific questions via programmatic means. As well as the results data, we use Web Annotations to store additional user-generated data, such as image tags. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these annotations are available via a public API that complies with a [standardised protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/). The API can be used to gain programmatic access to our current results data. Depending on the objective, this method of consuming and analysing the data is likely to present advantages when compared with performing similar visualisations using offline datasets (i.e. those downloaded to your computer). Importantly, data requested via the API will always be up-to-date, as very soon after a task is completed the contributions will be analysed and the result made available via the API."

    "Results are returned in containers called Annotation Collections. The JSON-LD (JSON Linked Data) structure used to model Annotation Collections comprises key-value pairs, where each key has some semantic meaning. To avoid overloading this notebook with new concepts (perhaps it's too late), we won't go into the semantic meaning of each key. For now, it is enough to understand that there are consistent ways to programmatically navigate these data structures and pull out the information required, regardless of where they are stored or how they were produced.\n",

These are generated after at least three people have contributed to a single task where a task may be, for example, to transcribe a previously marked up region on an image. The contributions are normalised and the final result saved as an annotation if three of the normalised contributions match. If we don't find a match, the tasks are sent back into the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The annotations are generated according to the structure of the example annotation presented below. Don't worry if this doesn't make any sense just yet, the relevant sections will be explored in a bit more detail later. For now, note that the annotations are stored as JSON-LD; a method of encoding Linked Data using JSON.

This is where reference to the [LibCrowds Data Model](https://docs.libcrowds.com/data/model/) becomes necessary in order to understand how these nested fields are structured. As the example annotation towards the top of this page shows, our describing annotations contain two bodies.
